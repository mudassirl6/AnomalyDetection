Customer Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest
1.overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (customer.ipynb) that demonstrates how to detect anomalies in customer data using the Isolation Forest algorithm. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, and visualization of results and characteristics.

2.Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you'll need the following dependencies installed:
Python 3.7+
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Required Python packages (listed below)
Required Libraries
You can install the required packages using pip:


4.Install Dependencies: Ensure all required packages are installed as listed in the requirements.txt
5.Running the Notebook
-->When all the dependencies are satisfied just run all cells of the jupyter notebook.

6.Steps to run the ipynb file on jupyter interface:
    -->In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the customer.ipynb file and open it.
    -->Run the cells sequentially to execute the code. The notebook includes explanations and results after each code block.
    Visualizations
    -->The notebook generates various plots to help visualize the data and the anomalies detected by the Isolation Forest. These include:

    Pair plots for feature analysis
    -->2D and 3D scatter plots showing normal and anomalous data points
    Anomaly score distributions
    Notes:please follow the above notes.
    The dataset used in the notebook is assumed to be preloaded or available within the notebook itself.
    If any data files are required, make sure they are placed in the same directory as the notebook or adjust the file paths accordingly.
